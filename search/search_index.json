A common workflow among many data scientists when getting a new dataset is to create a notebook for reading the data and getting and overview about the properties of the data. The including steps, such as identifiying existing data types, collecting statistics about the missing values and creating plot to observe the distribution of the variables. Exploration steps like this are not considered as a creative work and mostly consumes a lot of time to implement. Explorodo is a Python library to automate this process. Given a data set, Explorodo automatically creates a Jupyter notebook, which contains most of the code required for explorative data analysis. The notebook includes not only the results, but also the implementations, so that the data scientist can modify it according to their needs. Key Features Automatic Generation of a Jupyter notebook for EDA Support for Classification Tasks How To Use Define tha path to the data set for which you want to generate and explorative data analysis report path = \"../data/iris.csv\" Create an exploration object by calling the explore method from explorodo.exploration import explore exploration = explore ( path , mode = \"classification\" , target = \"class\" ) Create a notebook file using the exploration object created in the previous step. Give it a name and specify a language from explorodo.notebook import Notebook Notebook ( exploration ) . name ( \"iris_exploration\" ) . tongue ( \"en\" ) . build () Installation pip install explorodo","title":"Home"},{"location":"#explorodo-automatic-explorative-data-analysis","text":"Many steps in explorative data analysis (eda) can be considered as repitetive tasks.
